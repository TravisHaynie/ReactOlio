      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Travis Haynie. I am an aspiring web developer with over a decade of experience 
        in leadership as a VP of Construction Management in the commercial painting industry. 
        My background has equipped me with strong project management, problem-solving, and team leadership skills, 
        which I am now transitioning into the tech world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently enrolled in a full-stack web development program, I am learning technologies such as HTML, CSS, 
        JavaScript, MongoDB, and Express.js. Although I'm still growing as a developer, Iâ€™m passionate about coding 
        and eager to leverage my management experience to contribute to the tech industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        What excites me the most about web development is the combination of creativity and problem-solving. 
        I enjoy building intuitive, user-friendly interfaces and am always looking for ways to improve and expand 
        my technical skills. With a focus on front-end development, I aim to create solutions that enhance the user 
        experience while maintaining clean and efficient code.
